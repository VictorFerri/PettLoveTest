# PettLoveTest

The project offers a taste of how a website can be dedicated to helping animal lovers explore various breeding options for their beloved pets. During development, I strictly followed a template, paying attention to all the details of the page as a whole and ensuring that the layout was pixel-perfect. In addition, I needed to focus on responsive development to ensure a consistent and intuitive experience across different devices and screen sizes.
